# Vision-1.0

Globally, among the 7.79 billion people around the world, there are an
estimated 49.1 million people who are considered to be blind. These people
have a hard time getting around and this project is designed to help those
people. The project is to develop a simple system that helps them to navigate by detecting nearby obstacles using the help of ultrasonic waves and machine learning and notifies them with a strong vibration and sound.
